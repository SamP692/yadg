## What is this?

YADG is a game in which the user places bets on fictional sporting events in an effort to grow their cash to $1,000,000. Each 'day' the user has 10 sporting events to pick from, all with fictional betting odds. The small twist is that the user has a betting team that also provides feedback on every game (in the form of percentage likelihood for each team to win).

## Some Items of Note

The **Check Winnings** button simply shows you what your bets *would* win based on the odds they're given. To submit your bets and simulate all the games, you must click **Play Games**, at which point you will immediately see your earnings (or losses) reflected in your cash.
